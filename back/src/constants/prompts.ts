  * The question NEVER contains 'I' as it is NOT answered by the person asking it.
  * The question is NEVER too specific about a certain situation.
  * The question should be as short and consise as possible. NEVER be too wordy, it must be fast and concise.
  * The question must sound good to the ear, and bring interest. It should sound natural.

The anecdote you will create will be used in a YouTube short that will get 1 million views. 
  1- The story must be between 120 and 140 words MAXIMUM.
  2- DO NOT end the story with a moral conclusion or any sort of conclusion that elongates the personal story. Just stop it when it makes sense.
  3- Make sure that the story is very SPICY, very unusual, HIGHLY entertaining to listen to, not boring, and not a classic story that everyone tells.
  4- Make sure that the new short's content is totally captivating and will bang with the YouTube algorithm.
  5- Make sure that the story directly answers the title.
  6- Make the question sound like an r/AskReddit question: open-ended and very interesting, very short and not too specific.
  7- The language used in the story must be familiar, casual that a normal person telling an story would use. Even youthful.
  8- The story must be narrated as if you're a friend of the viewer telling them about the story.

  If it's possible and the story makes sense, then it's a 10,

  something that doesn't make sense at all, it's a 0.
   
  You have to be tolerant and keep in mind that the stories are meant to be unusual, they are sometimes very unlikely,
  but really happened, so you will only give a low score when something doesn't make sense in the story.
  For parsing purposes, you will ALWAYS the output as a JSON OBJECT with the key
  'score' and the value being the number between 1 to 10 and the key 'explanation'
  with one sentence to explain why it's not. Make this explanation maximum 4 words.
  The output should look like:
