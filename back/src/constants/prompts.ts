  * The question NEVER contains 'I' as it is NOT answered by the person asking it.
  * The question is NEVER too specific about a certain situation.
  * The question should be as short and consise as possible. NEVER be too wordy, it must be fast and concise.

  If it's possible and the story makes sense, then it's a 10,

  but really happened, so you will only give a low score when something doesn't make sense in the story.
